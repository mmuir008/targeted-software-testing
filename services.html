    <h2>QA Testing Services (<a href="qa.html">details</a>)</h2>
    <p>Software QA testing is the process of systematically evaluating a software application to ensure it meets specified requirements and works as intended. It involves identifying bugs, verifying functionality, and ensuring quality, reliability, and user satisfaction before release.</p>
    <h2>Cyber-security Testing (<a href="security.html">details</a>)</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity testing is the process of evaluating an application, system, or network to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could be exploited by attackers. Its goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by simulating real-world attack scenarios and validating security controls.</p>
    <h2>UAT Testing (<a href="uat.html">details</a>)</h2>
    <p>User Acceptance Testing is the final phase of testing before a product goes live. The goal is to verify that the system meets business needs and that real users are happy with how it works. Unlike unit or functional testing, UAT is not about technical correctness â€” it's about fitness for purpose from the user's perspective.</p>
